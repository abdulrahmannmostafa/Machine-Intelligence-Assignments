Environment Description:
    The snake is a 2D grid world where the snake can move in 4 directions.
    The snake always starts at the center of the level (floor(W/2), floor(H/2)) having a length of 1 and moving LEFT.
    The snake can wrap around the grid.
    The snake can eat apples which will grow the snake by 1.
    The snake can not eat itself.
    You win if the snake body covers all of the level (there is no cell that is not occupied by the snake).
    You lose if the snake bites itself (the snake head enters a cell occupied by its body).
    The action can not move the snake in the opposite direction of its current direction.
    The action can not move the snake in the same direction 
        i.e. (if moving right don't give an action saying move right).
    Eating an apple increases the reward by 1.
    Winning the game increases the reward by 100.
    Losing the game decreases the reward by 100.
